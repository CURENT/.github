# CURENT Large-scale Testbed

The Large Scale Testbed (LTB), is the first of its kind to provide a virtual electric power grid for researchers to experiment with closed-loop controls and algorithms.

Research and application ideas can be quickly and seamlessly integrated for verification in this virtual power system.

## CURENT LTB was selected as 2020 R&D 100 Award Recipient

The CURENT Large Scale Testbed (LTB) for cyber-physical power grid simulation has been selected as [a recipient of the 2020 R&D 100 Awards](https://www.rdworldonline.com/rd-100-2020-winner/curent-ltb/), which are known as the most prestigious innovation awards program for the past 56 years, honoring 100 great R&D revolutionary ideas and products each year in science and technology.
