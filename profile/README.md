# CURENT Large Scale Testbed

The CURENT Large Scale Testbed (LTB), is the first of its kind to provide a virtual electric power grid for researchers to experiment with closed-loop controls and algorithms. Research and application ideas can be quickly and seamlessly integrated for verification in this virtual power system.

LTB includes four core packages, [ANDES][andes repository], [AMS][ams repository] (currently in development), [AGVis][agvis repository], and [DiME][dime repository]. These packages provide dynamic simulation, market simulation, geo-visualization, and data messaging environment, respectively. These packages can be used independently for specific research purposes or in combination for closed-loop studies. To simplify the process, we also provide a repository [ltb][ltb repository] that includes all four packages as submodules."

The CURENT Large Scale Testbed for cyber-physical power grid simulation has been selected as ***[a recipient of the 2020 R&D 100 Awards][rd100]***, which are known as the most prestigious innovation awards program for the past 56 years, honoring 100 great R&D revolutionary ideas and products each year in science and technology.
