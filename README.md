# About CURENT

CURENT, Center for Ultra-Wide-Area Resilient Electric Energy Transmission Networks, is a graduated National Science Foundation (NSF) Engineering Research Center that was jointly supported by NSF and the Department of Energy (DoE) for a period of 10 years before becoming self-sustaining. A collaboration between academia, industry, and national laboratories, CURENT is led by the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Partner institutions include Northeastern University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and Tuskegee University.

# CURENT's Vision

- A nation-wide or continent-wide transmission grid that is fully monitored and dynamically controlled in real-time for high efficiency, high reliability, low cost, better accommodation of renewable energy sources, full utilization of energy storage, and accommodation of responsive load.
- A new generation of electric power and energy systems engineering leaders with global perspectives and diverse backgrounds.

# Large-scale Testbed

The Large Scale Testbed (LTB), is the first of its kind to provide a virtual electric power grid for researchers to experiment with closed-loop controls and algorithms.
Research and application ideas can be quickly and seamlessly integrated for verification in this virtual power system.
